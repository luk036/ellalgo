class LMI0Oracle:
    """
    Oracle for the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraint: F(x) ⪰ 0.

    This class is a specialized oracle for solving the LMI feasibility problem
    where the constant matrix `B` is zero. The constraint is of the form:

        F(x) = F₁x₁ + F₂x₂ + ... + Fₙxₙ ⪰ 0

    where `Fᵢ` are symmetric matrices and `x` is the vector of decision
    variables.

    The `assess_feas` method checks if a given solution `x` satisfies the LMI
    constraint. If it does, the method returns `None`. If not, it returns a
    separating hyperplane (a "cut") that separates the infeasible point from
    the feasible set.
